## Project Include
Welcome to the future, where everyone has the opportunity to be exposed to coding in some way or form that is inviting and hopefully exciting. Where even those in underrepresented social groups within the technology industry can come to understand that coding is not intimidating - that it is fun, and allows one to create. Weâ€™re not there yet. But with your help, we can be.

We organize workshops, mini-courses and fundraising campaigns aimed at creating the needed spark to ignite a potential interest in technology, especially in local and global communities where opportunities are not presently accessible.
